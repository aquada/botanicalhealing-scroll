<p>Phytotherapy is the practice of <strong>herbal medicine</strong>. Phytotherapists follow a <strong>holistic approach</strong> in the treatment of disease by using herbal prescriptions, diet and advice on lifestyle in the treatment of disease.</p>
<p>It is the oldest form of medicine known, and in all societies of the world there is a long history of the use of herbs as medicine. With advancements in science these ancient cures are being investigated and their healing powers are being confirmed. Science has also enabled us to identify the chemical constituents of the herbs and in this way allows us to understand their healing powers.</p>

<p>Many modern medicines have their origins in plant medicines but only the isolated active constituent is used. Phytotherapy maintains that it is the vast array of constituents in a plant that work synergistically to restore the balance of the body, and to mobilise the body&rsquo;s innate healing powers.</p>
<p>For example, the anti-inflammatory chemical Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) was derived from salicylic acid, a constituent initially isolated from plants such as <em>Filipendula ulmaria</em> (meadowsweet) and <em>Salix alba</em> (willow bark). In its isolated form salicylic acid irritates the stomach lining, but when it is consumed as whole plant extract, the constituents act together to reduce inflammation without causing irritation to the digestive tract.</p>
<p>Phytotherapists prescribe herbs in the form of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teas (whole dried herbs)</li>
<li>Tablets (powdered dried herbs)</li>
<li>Tinctures (alcoholic extracts of whole plants)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The prescription is tai  lored to suit the individual. Externally creams, ointments or oils may be prescribed. Phytotherapists only prescribe whole plant extracts, based on the principle that the whole plant contains a perfect balance of therapeutic chemical constituents. {.is-info}</p></blockquote>

<p>How do herbs work?</p>
<p>Each herb is unique; it is composed of a distinctive combination of <strong>different active constituents</strong>, and as such has its own identity.</p>
<ul>
<li>The constituents work synergistically within the human body to achieve the herb&rsquo;s specific action.</li>
<li>They may include nutrients as well as chemically active substances, which makes herbal medicine unique in its action of simultaneously <strong>nourishing and healing</strong> the body.- Herbs are chosen by the Phytotherapist to suit the individual.</li>
<li>Potent medicinal substances have the potential to harm as well as heal. It is important, therefore, to <strong>avoid self-medicating</strong> and always to seek professional individualised herbal treatment from a registered Phytotherapist.</li>
<li>During the course of treatment, the prescription may be altered according to the body&rsquo;s changing requirements.</li>
</ul>

<p>Phytotherapists are <strong>trained in the same diagnostic skills as orthodox doctors</strong> and combine this knowledge with a holistic understanding of disease.</p>
<ul>
<li>The cause of the disease is treated, not only the symptoms. Herbs are used to restore balance in the body and mobilise the body&rsquo;s innate healing powers.</li>
<li>The first consultation with a Phytotherapist will generally take at least an hour.</li>
<li>The Phytotherapist will take notes on the patient&rsquo;s medical history and do physical examinations as deemed appropriate.</li>
<li>The treatment will be tailored to suit the individual. It will include a herbal prescription and may include advice on diet and lifestyle.</li>
<li>The second appointment may follow in two to three weeks, subsequent consultations occurring monthly or as dictated by the health problem.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="what-can-phytotherapy-treat">What can Phytotherapy treat?</h5>
<p>Phytotherapy can treat <strong>most conditions</strong> on which patients might consult their doctor.</p>
<ul>
<li>Qualified Phytotherapists know when a patient or condition is best treated by another healthcare professional and will refer the patient for other treatment as required.</li>
<li>Phytotherapists are trained to understand herb-drug interactions and can safely treat patients who are using pharmaceutical medication.</li>
