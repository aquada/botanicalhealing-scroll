![Dr Catherine van Dorsten](./images/Dr_Catherine_van_Dorsten.jpg)

I trained at the University of the Western Cape (UWC), completing a 5-year double bachelors programme. As students we were trained in the use and knowledge of safe and effective Western and indigenous herbal medicines. Once qualified I registered with the Allied Health Professions Council of South Africa ([A.H.P.C.S.A.](https://ahpcsa.co.za)) and became a member of the South African Association of Registered Phytotherapists ([S.A.A.R.P.](https://phytotherapists.co.za)). I am currently the Treasurer of S.A.A.R.P. and a Council member of A.H.P.C.S.A.

I live in Greyton, a village in the Overberg region of the Western Cape, with my partner and our two young daughters.  I have been in private practice here since 2016.
