![Dr Catherine van Dorsten](./images/Dr_Catherine_van_Dorsten.jpg)

I trained at the University of the Western Cape (UWC), completing a 5 year double bachelors programme. As students we were trained in the use and knowledge of safe and effective Western and indigenous herbal medicines.Once qualified I registered with the Allied Health Professions Council of South Africa (AHPCSA) and became a member of the South African Association of Registered Phytotherapists (SAARP). I am currently acting as Secretary of SAARP.

My partner and I moved to Greyton, a beautiful village in the Overberg region of the Western Cape, where I have been in private practice since 2016.
