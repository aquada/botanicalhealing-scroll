The cause of the disease is treated, not only the symptoms. Herbs are used to restore balance in the body and mobilise the body’s innate healing powers.Your first consultation with me will generally take 1 to 1.5 hours and consists of taking notes on your medical history and performing physical examinations as deemed appropriate. The treatment will be tailored to suit you as an individual. It will include a herbal prescription and may include advice on diet and lifestyle.

Your second appointment will follow in two to three weeks, subsequent consultations occurring monthly or as dictated by the health problem. Phytotherapy can treat most conditions for which you might consult your doctor.  As a qualified Phytotherapist I know when you would be best treated by another healthcare professional and I will refer you for other treatment as required.  As Phytotherapists we are trained to understand herb-drug interactions and can safely treat patients who are using pharmaceutical medication.
