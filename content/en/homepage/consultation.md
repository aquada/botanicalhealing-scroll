##### A Phytotherapist's approach
As a Registered Phytotherapist I am **trained in the same diagnostic skills as conventional doctors** and combine this knowledge with a holistic understanding of disease.
- The cause of the disease is treated, not only the symptoms. Herbs are used to restore balance in the body and mobilise the body's innate healing powers.
- The first consultation with me will generally take 1 to 1.5 hours.
- I will take notes on the patient's medical history and perform physical examinations as deemed appropriate.
- The treatment will be tailored to suit the individual. It will include a herbal prescription and may include advice on diet and lifestyle.
- The second appointment may follow in two to three weeks, subsequent consultations occurring monthly or as dictated by the health problem.

##### What can Phytotherapy treat?
Phytotherapy can treat **most conditions** on which patients might consult their doctor.
- As a qualified Phytotherapist I know when you would be best treated by another healthcare professional and I will refer you for other treatment as required. 
- As Phytotherapists we are trained to understand herb-drug interactions and can safely treat patients who are using pharmaceutical medication.
