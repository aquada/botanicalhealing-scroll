##### A Phytotherapist's approach

Phytotherapists are **trained in the same diagnostic skills as orthodox doctors** and combine this knowledge with a holistic understanding of disease.

- The cause of the disease is treated, not only the symptoms. Herbs are used to restore balance in the body and mobilise the body's innate healing powers.
- The first consultation with a Phytotherapist will generally take at least an hour.
- The Phytotherapist will take notes on the patient's medical history and do physical examinations as deemed appropriate.
- The treatment will be tailored to suit the individual. It will include a herbal prescription and may include advice on diet and lifestyle.
- The second appointment may follow in two to three weeks, subsequent consultations occurring monthly or as dictated by the health problem.

##### What can Phytotherapy treat?

Phytotherapy can treat **most conditions** on which patients might consult their doctor.

- Qualified Phytotherapists know when a patient or condition is best treated by another healthcare professional and will refer the patient for other treatment as required.
- Phytotherapists are trained to understand herb-drug interactions and can safely treat patients who are using pharmaceutical medication.
