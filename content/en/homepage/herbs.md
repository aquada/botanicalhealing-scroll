Each herb is unique; it is composed of a distinctive combination of different active constituents, and as such has its own identity.


The constituents work synergistically within the human body to achieve the herbâ€™s specific action. They may include nutrients as well as chemically active substances, which makes herbal medicine unique in its action of simultaneously nourishing and healing the body.


Herbs are chosen by the Phytotherapist to suit the individual.  Potent medicinal substances have the potential to harm as well as heal. It is important, therefore, to avoid self-medicating and always to seek professional individualised herbal treatment from a registered Phytotherapist.
